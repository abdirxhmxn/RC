        <h1>Welcome to my Resume Page!</h1>
        <img src="self.JPG" alt="Dope Selfie">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Abdirahman Mohamed, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
            the
            University of Southern Maine. Along the way, I’ve built a strong foundation in everything from data
            structures
            and algorithms to artificial intelligence and systems programming. But for me, learning has never just been
            about textbooks, rather it’s been about creating. I’ve developed projects like an advanced calculator in
            Python that
            can handle complex expressions, and a Java-based dice game with AI-driven gameplay that balances strategy
            with
            fun. I also worked as a QA intern at Lingocard, where I tested cross-platform software, tracked bugs, and
            learned how much teamwork and precision matter in real-world development.</p>
        <p>Outside of tech, I’ve invested deeply in leadership and community. I founded and directed a summer camp for
            kids
            ages 6 to 16, building a space where sports, Arabic lessons, and Islamic studies came together to teach
            teamwork, creativity, and personal growth. That experience reminded me that what really matters — whether in
            coding, teaching, or leading — is creating environments where people can thrive. I’m passionate about
            technology
            not just as a career path, but as a way to solve problems and make a difference. My goal is to continue
            growing
            as a developer while also building things that leave a lasting impact on both people and communities.</p>

        <h2>Employment History</h2>
        <h3>Founder & Instructor – Al Bayaan Institute | Sept 2024 – Present</h3>
        <p>I founded Al Bayaan Institute to reignite the passion for Islamic learning in my community. Today, I teach
            60+ students Qur’an, Arabic, and Islamic studies while also handling the day-to-day operations — from
            creating policies and organizing Qur’an competitions to designing tuition systems and building a strong
            culture of learning. Al Bayaan is more than a classroom; it’s a hub for growth, mentorship, and community
            impact.</p>

        <h3>Direct Support Professional (DSP) – Creative Works | 2021 – 2022</h3>
        <p> At Creative Works, I supported individuals with disabilities in developing life skills, gaining
            independence, and engaging with the community. The role taught me patience, empathy, and adaptability, while
            also strengthening my communication and leadership skills. More than a job, it was an opportunity to make a
            real impact on people’s daily lives and personal growth.</p>

        <h3> Manual QA Intern – Lingocard (Remote) | May 2022 – Aug 2022</h3>
        <p>During my internship at Lingocard, I worked on exploratory testing, built detailed test cases, and tracked
            bugs using Jira. I performed smoke and regression testing, verified bug fixes, and collaborated in Agile
            sprints with the development team. This role sharpened my eye for detail, reinforced the importance of
            thorough documentation, and gave me real-world experience in software quality assurance.</p>

        <h2>Leadership Experience</h2>
        <p>Leadership for me has always been about more than holding a title, it’s about building spaces where people
            can grow. I’ve led in different ways: from founding Al Bayaan Institute, where I teach and mentor over 60
            students while managing the full operations of a growing educational center, to directing a youth summer
            camp that balanced fun, learning, and teamwork for kids ages 6–16. Along the way, I’ve also worked as a DSP
            at Creative Works, where I learned patience, empathy, and how to support people in reaching their full
            potential. Whether in classrooms, camps, or community programs, I’ve shown that leadership is about service,
            vision, and making sure the people you guide leave stronger than when they arrived.</p>
